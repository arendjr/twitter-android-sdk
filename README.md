# Twitter SDK for Android

This is an unofficial Java Twitter SDK implementation for Android. It contains a library and sample application project. Currently only supports authentication through a WebView dialog.

This fork builds upon the code from me.grantland.twitter and adds a nice method for doing API calls.
